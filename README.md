We directly retrieved the preprocessed physiological data recordings from the DEAP experiment, which included steps such as downsampling, EOG (electrooculography) removal, filtering, and segmenting, among others. 

By employing the bandpower method, we extracted specific frequency band power information from the EEG (electroencephalography) data. 

In a supervised learning context using the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, the performance on the training set and test set was 0.71 and 0.61, respectively.
